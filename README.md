Nailgun is a client, protocol, and server for running Java programs from
the command line without incurring the JVM startup overhead.

Nailgun 1.0 is not compatible with Java 9 and later.

Programs run in the server (which is implemented in Java), and are 
triggered by the client (written in C), which handles all I/O.

The server and examples are built using maven.  From the project directory,
"mvn clean install" will do it.

The client is built using make.  From the project directory, 
"make && sudo make install" will do it.  To create the windows client
you will additionally need to "make ng.exe".

A ruby client is available through the [railgun](https://github.com/timuralp/railgun) project.
